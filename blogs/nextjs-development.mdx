# Building with Next.js

Next.js has become one of the most popular React frameworks for building modern web applications. In this post, I'll share my experiences working with Next.js and why it might be the right choice for your next project.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and other powerful features with minimal configuration. Created by Vercel, it has gained significant traction in the web development community.

## Key Features That Make Next.js Stand Out

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

One of the primary advantages of Next.js is its built-in support for server-side rendering:

```jsx
// pages/ssr-example.js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await res.json()
  
  return {
    props: { data }, // passed to the page component as props
  }
}

function SSRPage({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Server-side rendered data</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  )
}

export default SSRPage
```

### 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)

For content that doesn't change frequently, Next.js offers static site generation:

```jsx
// pages/ssg-example.js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/static-data')
  const data = await res.json()
  
  return {
    props: { data },
    revalidate: 60 // regenerate page every 60 seconds if requested
  }
}

function SSGPage({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Statically generated content</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  )
}

export default SSGPage
```

### 3. File-Based Routing

Next.js's intuitive file-based routing system makes creating new pages straightforward:

```
pages/
├── index.js         // maps to /
├── about.js         // maps to /about
└── blog/
    ├── index.js     // maps to /blog
    └── [slug].js    // maps to /blog/:slug
```

## Getting Started with Next.js

Setting up a Next.js project is remarkably simple:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

## Why I Choose Next.js for My Projects

After working with various frameworks, I've found Next.js to be an excellent choice for several reasons:

1. **Developer Experience**: The fast refresh feature makes development smooth and efficient
2. **Performance**: Built-in optimizations like automatic image optimization
3. **Scalability**: Works well for both small and large applications
4. **Community Support**: Large and active community with plenty of resources

## Common Challenges and Solutions

While Next.js is powerful, it's not without its challenges:

### Challenge: Managing Global State

For complex applications, state management can become challenging. I typically use React Context or Redux depending on the complexity:

```jsx
// store/AppContext.js
import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react'

const AppContext = createContext()

export function AppWrapper({ children }) {
  const [state, setState] = useState({
    theme: 'light',
    user: null
  })
  
  return (
    <AppContext.Provider value={{ state, setState }}>
      {children}
    </AppContext.Provider>
  )
}

export function useAppContext() {
  return useContext(AppContext)
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js continues to evolve with each release, making it an increasingly powerful tool for web development. Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex web application, Next.js provides the tools and flexibility to create fast, SEO-friendly, and user-friendly websites.
